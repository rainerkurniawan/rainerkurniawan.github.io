I am currently working on discoverability improvement for two verticals (apparel and bags). I work with Experience squad to handle browsing experience and personalization. My goal is to create a relevant and smooth experience for our users in finding items they want to rent.

I involved in building the product from scratch until assigned as a product manager for transactional modules and artificial intelligence products. As a product manager, I managed the end-to-end product development process starts from gathering requirements, creating the wireframe, designing the user experience, testing the product, presenting the result to clients. 

Worked as a squad with members in multiple cities (Bandung, Jakarta, Bali, Yogyakarta, and Surabaya) and successfully launched the most challenging transactional module within 6 months. Contributes to save company costs by 80% and the modules are used by 15 companies in Indonesia. 

Converted lead from one of the biggest Catapa's client and increased company revenue by 50%.Â
